# Module-1-Challenge-SemanticHTML

## Description

The primary motivation for this project was improve my HTML and CSS skills. My main goal for this project was to better optimize and improve accessability and readability of the code. I was able to re-structure the code into a more Semantic focus, adjusting the CSS and adding notes along the way. I combined certain CSS selectors to save space, properly ordered heading attributes, and gave a descriptive title to the webpage as well. I learned that as a developer, I can always make code a little more efficient and improve upon it.
